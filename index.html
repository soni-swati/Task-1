        <h2>School Environment Description</h2>
        <p>
          A school is a place where students come to gain knowledge, grow in
          discipline, and build their future. The environment of a good school
          is clean, safe, friendly, and full of learning opportunities.

        <h3>Our School has rules to maintain order and discipline. Some common rules are:</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Wear the school uniform properly.</li>
          <li>Be respectful to teachers and classmates.</li>
          <li>No mobile phones in class.</li>
          <li>Arrive on time.</li>
          <li>Complete homework regularly.</li>
          <li>Keep the school clean and avoid littering.</li>
          <li>No fighting or bullying.</li>
        </ul>

        Following these rules helps create a peaceful and productive learning space for everyone.

        <h2>Students</h2>
        <p>
          Students are the heart of the school. They come from different backgrounds and attend school to study, make
          friends, and develop their skills. They wear uniforms, follow a timetable, and participate in different
          activities like sports, music, and arts. Good students are respectful, punctual, and eager to learn.
        </p>

        <h2>Teachers</h2>
        <p>
          Teachers are the pillars of the school. They guide students, explain lessons, and help them understand the
          world. A good teacher is kind, patient, and always ready to help. Teachers also prepare exams, check homework,
          and encourage students to do their best.
        </p>

        <h2>Principal</h2>
        <p>
          The principal is the head of the school. They are responsible for managing all school activities, staff, and
          student discipline. A principal ensures that the school runs smoothly and that everyone follows the rules.
          They often meet with teachers, students, and parents to solve problems and improve the school environment.
